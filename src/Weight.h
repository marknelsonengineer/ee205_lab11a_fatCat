/// Every Animal has a Weight.
///
/// C++ maintains Weight as a `float`, however, weights in the physical world
/// have certain constraints (i.e. you can't have a negative weight -- or you
/// *may* have a maximum weight.
///
/// By default, the weight is UNKNOWN_WEIGHT.  Once it's known, it can never
/// be un-known.
///
/// If the Weight has a maximum weight, then weight must be <= it.  Also,
/// the weight can never be <= 0.  The maximum weight must be set in the
/// constructor and it can not be changed.
///
/// Weight can can be expressed in multiple units of measure.  The Weight's
/// unit of measure can be set in the constructor and can not be changed.  It
/// defaults to the POUND.
